    <h3>The Game:</h3>
    <p>Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid.</p>
    <p>
      The goal of the game is to fill all cells of the grid with digits from 1
      to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids
      (also known as blocks) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Write a function
      <code>validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() </code> that accepts
      a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid
      solution, or false otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent
      empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be
      invalid solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains
      integers from 0 to 9.
    </p>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <h3>Methodology:</h3>
    <h5>Variables:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Board: 9 arrays, the sudoku board</li>
      <li>helperArray: items are added here if they do not already exist</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps:</h5>
    <p>There are three Sets of loops in this algorithm, they are as follows</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        This set of 2 loops walks through the horizontal values in each array,
        checking them against helper array
      </li>
      <li>
        Another set of identical for loops, but this one checks "vertically" by
        switching the [i] and[j] values around
      </li>
      <li>
        The final is a set of three loops. It validates the 3x3 squares of a
        sodoku board. The first (i) is for iterating through all 9 squares, the
        second (J) is for iterating through each "row" of a 3x3 square, and the
        3rd(K) is for checking the columns of the 3x3 square
      </li>
    </ol>
